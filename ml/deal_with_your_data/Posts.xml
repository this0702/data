Sometimes that involves not going to what they directly wrote, because sometimes that's not the most effective way to go about it. For much the same as there are people who can't use alternatives, there are people who didn't &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about the alternative options in the first place. It's very easy when some askers run into a problem, to tunnel-vision that &quot;I must solve it this way&quot; and then someone provides a very enlightening view by working outside the box the asker had situated inside. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, this is also part of the very nature as to why these sites permit more than one answer to a question. It is to allow different routes to solve the same problem. Some will be the direct route that is asked, others will take shortcuts as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It remains though that naturally, sometimes an alternative, be it a particular one or just in general, is not permissible. When this is the case, that kind of a restriction is &lt;em&gt;part of the problem&lt;/em&gt;. As such if the asker can't work with a given alternative, and if the only answers they're getting is that alternative, it's to them to modify their question to exclude that alternative as an option. Or if it is a known quantity to begin with, a pre-emptitive exclusion present in the question when asked is very appropriate. On the other side, if a reader happens upon a question and cannot utilize the alternatives that exist there, then they are welcome to recreate the question in a fashion which excludes the alternatives since their situation cannot cater to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sans such an explicit exclusion, if the asker can work with the alternative, or if they still receive other answers that do not employ that alternative, there's no foul going on as a result. It's fine to dislike something being provided as an alternative, but it's by no means something we're going to discourage on a level to the point of flagging. Downvotes, those are yours to give as you see fit to things that you believe are not helpful - I could say something like &quot;It's probably more appropriate to downvote if a particular alternative is actively unhelpful to you, as opposed to a post which you stumble across in random browsing which just &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; to be an alternative&quot;, but at the same vein, you could still deem it unhelpful and the vote is yours to cast. Just be open to the fact that if the alternative &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work for other people, it's going to remain acceptable on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2" LastActivityDate="2016-01-13T14:57:44.823" CommentCount="6" />

There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do agree that, so far, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legal&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;legal&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030&quot;&gt;a comment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have the same situation here. Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legal&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;legal&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that all &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legal&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;legal&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legal&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;legal&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; questions.

But when I started 3D-printing, that's certainly where a large part of my questions lay. It's because the materials are DIFFERENT than ones we're used to dealing with, and if it weren't for 3D-printing, I wouldn't have been working with them then. It's BECAUSE I was 3D-printing that the questions arose. There are certainly similarities between the materials used for 3D-printing and other materials we might run into, but there are also vast differences. For example, ABS is the same plastic that we know from Legos. But how does working with the plastic that's been 3D-printed differ from working with a Lego? I would consider any question about that area to be valid. You mention drilling plastic, but then got the answer wrong. It is NOT like drilling wood; the way you drill plastic should be different from how you deal with wood, such as the speeds used and the use of hand drills. There are even special plastic bits that you can buy that make it easier to drill plastic. Good questions might be: for PLA, ABS and other 3dpg plastics, when is it appropriate to use such bits and when can you get away with using high speed drill bits like you would use for wood? Are higher drill speeds better than lower speeds for some 3D-printed plastics and not others, or vice versa?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I feel that questions about a technique or material that is being used in the 3D-printing process, or dealing with the materials afterward, should be valid because 3D-printing changes how the techniques are done or the materials are dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="265" LastActivityDate="2016-01-23T04:28:11.173" CommentCount="0" />

I personally find the structure of the StackExchange sites easy to navigate and appreciate the amount of moderation that goes into each site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Search Engines&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most traffic will most likely come from search engines (ie Google, Yahoo, etc.) which can find the questions/answers easiest from the use of Tags here on StackExchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the first thing to keep in mind is ensuring the tags you use are plenty and accurate with each question you ask. This will help increase the chances of a search engine showing your question higher in its results list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another factor, with regard to search engines, is the title of the question. Generally people are going to be more attracted to a specific question as they feel it will answer their question better. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extruder keeps jamming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as a question title will probably not attract users to view the question as it is very vague.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MakerBot Replicator extruder jams with new filament&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as a question title is more specific and contains more &quot;keywords&quot; that a search engine can find. Obviously, this can also potentially deter certain users (say Ultimaker users), but the hope is that the tag system will help offset this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Etiquette&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with you in that I also find it difficult to &quot;advertise&quot; the 3D printing community on other websites. As it may be considered improper etiquette here on the StackExchange network to advertise or promote other websites, I wouldn't recommend &quot;advertising&quot; the community as a whole. However, if you notice, many answers on the StackExchange network include links to other forum or Q&amp;amp;A sites (ie MSDN, CodeProject, etc.). With this in mind, I personally feel that it is appropriate to post links to specific questions here on the 3D Printing community on another site if it can benefit the users on the other site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are wanting to personally focus on bringing more traffic, you could participate on some of the forums you mentioned and try providing relevant links to this community. But, in the interest of maintaining quality on both websites, please remain respectful and courteous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-03-29T18:45:45.210" CommentCount="1" />

This just allows you to make copies of an existing model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we want to allow these types of questions, we should get the name of this site changed (to something like &quot;Makers SE&quot;/&quot;Rapid Prototyping&quot;).

We have Google for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our role in making the Internet a better place is in curating a high-quality collection of crowd-sourced knowledge. Stack Exchange rates very highly among search engines, so when someone clicks through thinking they finally found an answer from a highly-trusted source, &lt;strong&gt;we have a responsibility &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to purport having information we do not.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;sometimes it's better to accept not-perfect-answer than leave the man with no answer at all&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's a well-meaning consideration, but it ignores the purpose of curating this content as a whole.

Few people are actually privy to these meta discussions and what makes these Stack Exchange sites &quot;work&quot;, so oftentimes users looking on will largely consider the issue &lt;em&gt;resolved.&lt;/em&gt; Folks mostly emulate the practices and methods they see, so if cutting and pasting a link serves as an answer, then &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; can do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in that vein, please do not answer questions in comments.

Winter Bash is an annual event that can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users have fun by earning “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (very similar to badges). We track everyone’s progress using hats in a leaderboard that looks similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/OohHZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/OohHZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hats&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As always, we’re coming up with new hat designs for this year’s fun!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The event will run from 19 December 2016 up to and including 08 January 2017. Users will be able to see all the hats they’ve earned on &lt;a href=&quot;http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;. That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="115" LastActivityDate="2017-07-30T12:11:45.660" Title="Winter Bash 2016 coming up!

However, this must be my (inaccurate) perception, as the stats shows that the voting is not at the desired levels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it is important to votes and vote often, it is worth remembering that we shouldn't just vote willy-nilly. I have noticed that some beta sites, especially in the early days, tend to get rather frenzied (or, if you will, overly enthusiastic) voting, which one does not necessarily see in the more established sites, where the voting has settled down and only the (oft mentioned) &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; answers are voted for. This overly enthusiastic voting can &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; end up giving random votes to questions that are not particularly researched, or answers that are not fully accurate, which maybe do not deserve any votes at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure why this (comparatively) frenzied voting occurs, or why it dies down, nor am I sure what (which?) level of voting is appropriate - although it is obvious that poorly researched questions and inaccurate answers should not be voted up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I would agree that voting &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; act as an incentive to contribute to the site, as well as the idea that voting for a good question, or accurate answer, even if that question/answer does not apply directly to you, because it will help other users.

Between a review written by a random person on the internet and a review written by a user on the site who consistently gets a lot of upvotes, which review would you trust more?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This closed question would have fitted into a blog nicely: &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/4279/what-is-3d-printing&quot;&gt;What Is 3D Printing?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, yes, I think it would be worth starting one up and seeing how it goes... although I would be a little concerned about the regularity of posts: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan a schedule&lt;/strong&gt;. Given the results of steps #2 and #3, think about a rough idea of a schedule for the blog. Will there be one post a week, posted Mondays? Will there be posts on Tuesdays and posts on Fridays? You don’t need to be pushing out posts daily, but you should post at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a posting schedule and stick to it&lt;/strong&gt;. It is easier to simply keep up from the get go than catch up if you fall behind.  Have a couple draft posts stashed away for a rainy day, ready to go that can be published if there is a lull.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, who would coordinate it? Are you putting yourself forward?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have someone holding the reins&lt;/strong&gt;. This person doesn’t need to be the one writing all the posts, just someone that helps coordinate who is writing what and when it is getting posted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a bit of a misfortune that Blog Overflow has a rather unfortunately acronym (as well as sounding like &lt;em&gt;Bog&lt;/em&gt; Overflow).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4762" LastActivityDate="2017-06-30T19:22:42.077" CommentCount="2" />

The OP usually posts the question where they posted it because that is the Community they felt it associates with.  Migrating it often means the Community (and sometimes the OP) looses. Rather than just Migrating questions, I feel a better to also provide a way to ask for help from other Communities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?

If we want to grow our community, we need to put more effort into hitting the up arrow every time we think that a question or answer was worth the read.  &lt;strong&gt;Remember questions and answers are what fuels the community.
